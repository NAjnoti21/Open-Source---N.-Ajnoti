The file contains codes for two different algorithms according to our problem which were run in Matlab 2022a. 
The first one is Genetic Algorithm(GA) which has fitness function (SuratObjFnc.mlx) and main objective function (sample_main.mlx) and they are GA operators function necessary to run GA code.

The other one is Greedy Algorithm(GrA) which has only one code.

If you want to change any parameter, it is mentioned in code under comment.
